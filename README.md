# Flashcards
An implementation of [the fifth project of The C# Academy](https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/14).

## Project Description
The project is a console based "flashcard" learning application: you create flashcards, where each flashcard contains a "front" with a question and a "back" with an answer; the front side is shown to test your knowledge/memory, and your given answer is tested against the back side.
